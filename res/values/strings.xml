    <string name="basic_t1">What is Fluid?</string>
    <string name="basic_c1">Fluids flow under the action of such forces, deforming continuously for as long as the force is applied. A fluid is unable to retain any unsupported shape; it flows under its own weight and takes the shape of any solid body with which it comes into contact.</string>
    <string name="basic_t2">Fluid vs Solid</string>
    <string name="basic_c2">In most cases, substances can be classified easily as either solids or fluids. However, certain cases appear to be solids because their rate of deformation under their own weight is very small. </string>

    <string name="pipe_title">Laminar vs Turbulent</string>
    <string name="pipe_content">In pipes, at values of the Reynolds number above 2000, flow will not necessarily be turbulent. Laminar flow has been maintained up to Re = 50000, but conditions are unstable and any disturbance will cause reversion to normal turbulent flow. In straight pipes of constant diameter, flow can be assumed to be turbulent if the Reynolds number exceeds 4000. You can detemine by using the formula below.</string>
