    <string name="basic_t1">What is Fluid?</string>
    <string name="basic_c1">Fluids flow under the action of such forces, deforming continuously for as long as the force is applied. A fluid is unable to retain any unsupported shape; it flows under its own weight and takes the shape of any solid body with which it comes into contact.</string>
    <string name="basic_t2">Fluid vs Solid</string>
    <string name="basic_c2">In most cases, substances can be classified easily as either solids or fluids. However, certain cases appear to be solids because their rate of deformation under their own weight is very small. </string>

    <string name="pipe_title">Laminar vs Turbulent</string>
    <string name="pipe_content">In pipes, at values of the Reynolds number above 2000, flow will not necessarily be turbulent. Laminar flow has been maintained up to Re = 50000, but conditions are unstable and any disturbance will cause reversion to normal turbulent flow. In straight pipes of constant diameter, flow can be assumed to be turbulent if the Reynolds number exceeds 4000. You can detemine by using the formula below.</string>

    <string name="impact_title">Impact Force in Fluid</string>
    <string name="impact_content">The general rules of statics apply to fluids at rest, but, from the definition of a fluid, there will be no shearing forces acting and, therefore, all forces (such as F in Fig. (a)) exerted between the fluid and a solid boundary must act at right angles to the boundary. If the boundary is curved (Fig. (b)), it can be considered to be composed of a series of chords on each of which a force F1, F2, . . . , Fn acts perpendicular to the surface at the section concerned. Similarly, considering any plane drawn through a body of fluid at rest (Fig. (c)), the force exerted by one portion of the fluid on the other acts at right angles to this plane.</string>
